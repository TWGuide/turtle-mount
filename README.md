# Welcome to the Swift Riding Turtle mount guide!

**Here's a list of all the useful information related to the Darkmoon Faire and getting your very own turtle mount.**

* The Darkmoon Faire is an event that moves between **Mulgore** and **Elwynn Forest** every Sunday.

* The **[Swift Riding Turtle](<https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=23720>)** is a mount that every player can obtain from level 18+ at the Darkmoon Faire.  

* The turtle mount is a reward from the quest called **[Torta's Egg](<https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40302>)** offered by **Silas Darkmoon** and takes roughly half an hour to an hour to complete.  

* The turtle mount, just like all other mounts on TurtleWoW, has an adaptive speed based on your level or riding skill.   
>  Before you have any riding skill, the turtle's speed is 50% of your current level, e.g. at level 28 you would go at +14% speed vs on foot.  
>  Once a riding skill level is trained, the turtle will adjust to the speed you've learned (60% and 100%).

* Note that the turtle mount is not nearly as useful (besides mount cost savings) to high mobility classes, such as Hunters, Shamans, and Druids.

### This guide does not consider HC characters!

* This guide assumes you start in **Stormwind**

* Make your way to the [**Stormwind Harbor**](<https://imgur.com/Vqj4HCY>) 🖼️

* Travel from **Darkshore** to [**Mulgore**](<https://imgur.com/LxAK6lx>) 🖼️ 
  **Be careful** when crossing the border into **The Barrens**, stay to the east of the road and you should see a path through a broken fence which is safe for alliance to pass through
  **Be careful** around **Crossroads** and the straight path north of it, as there are horde outposts and guards along this road
  
* **Optional:** If you want, make a detour and grab the **Azshara** FP on your way to **Mulgore**, this is useful for when you're questing, and can be used to fly back up to **Ashenvale** from **Ratchet**. Just be careful in east region of [**Ashenvale**](<https://imgur.com/G8RY2P3>) 🖼️, there are Horde guards & mobs that will aggro you, even on the road!

* Once you've reached the [**Darkmoon Faire**](<https://imgur.com/nPR7Mir>) in **Mulgore**, accept the quest called **Torta's Egg** from [**Silas Darkmoon**](<https://imgur.com/nUoQzP0>) 🖼️

* After accepting the quest, make your way back up to **Ashenvale** until you reach [**The Zoram Strand**](<https://imgur.com/9dAjQr2>) 🖼️ using the same route as when you went down to **Mulgore**

* At **The Zoram Strand** kill Wrathtail Sea Witch/Sorceress/Razortail/Wave Rider until the egg drops

* Return to [**Silas Darkmoon**](<https://imgur.com/nUoQzP0>) 🖼️ in **Mulgore** using the same route as before and complete the quest!

### This guide does not consider HC Characters  

### Blue texts are links to images 🖼️ showing routes and locations (and one's a short vid 🎞️).  

* This guide assumes that you have set your **Hearthstone** to [**Orgrimmar**](<https://imgur.com/KFRh028>) 🖼️ as you'll be able to use it later to save time.  

* Starting from **Orgrimmar**, leave the city and head to the [**East Zeppelin Tower**](<https://imgur.com/a/MAhO6h3>) 🖼️ in **Durotar** and take the zeppelin on the *north dock* to **Stranglethorn Vale**.  

* When loaded into **Stranglethorn**, immediately [**jump off the zeppelin**](<https://imgur.com/a/Ikra24c>) 🎞️ and fall into the sea, then follow [**this route**](<https://imgur.com/a/obWbtPB>) 🖼️  

* **Be careful** of alliance camps and guards along the way from **Stranglethorn** to **Elwynn**!  

* At the [**Darkmoon Faire**](<https://imgur.com/yVzmWtP>) 🖼️ just south of **Goldshire**, grab the quest **Torta's Egg** from [**Silas Darkmoon**](<https://imgur.com/Si4Hf3V>) 🖼️  

* Now use your **Hearthstone** to return to [**Orgrimmar**](<https://i.imgur.com/KFRh028.jpeg>), saves you the time of running back to **Stranglethorn** and waiting for the Zeppelin!  

* Travel to [**The Zoram Strand**](<https://imgur.com/IPUXSPf>) 🖼️ from **Orgrimmar**  
  If you've been here before, don't forget that you can fly to either [**Splintertree Post**](<https://imgur.com/ZUB7o72>) 🖼️ or [**Zoram'gar Outpost**](<https://imgur.com/Ygt4AzG>) 🖼️ (which is directly on **The Zoram Strand**).  

* Kill Wrathtail Sea Witch/Sorceress/Razortail/Wave Rider until the **Torta's Egg** drops  

* Once the egg drops, return to **Silas Darkmoon** using the same route as before and complete the quest!
