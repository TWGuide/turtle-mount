# Welcome to the Swift Riding Turtle mount guide!

**Here's a list of all the useful information related to the Darkmoon Faire and getting your very own turtle mount.**

* The Darkmoon Faire is an event that moves between **Mulgore** and **Elwynn Forest** every Sunday.

* The **[Swift Riding Turtle](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=23720)** is a mount that every player can obtain from level 18+ at the Darkmoon Faire.  

* The turtle mount is a reward from the quest called **[Torta's Egg](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40302)** offered by **Silas Darkmoon** and takes roughly half an hour to an hour to complete.  

* The turtle mount, just like all other mounts on TurtleWoW, has an adaptive speed based on your level or riding skill.   
  Before you have any riding skill, the turtle's speed is 50% of your current level, e.g. at level 28 you would go at +14% speed vs on foot.  
  Once a riding skill level is trained, the turtle will adjust to the speed you've learned (60% and 100%).

* Note that the turtle mount is not nearly as useful (besides mount cost savings) to high mobility classes, such as Hunters, Shamans, and Druids.

  **Be careful** when crossing the border into **The Barrens**, stay to the east of the road and you should see a path through a broken fence which is safe for alliance to pass through
  **Be careful** around **Crossroads** and the straight path north of it, as there are horde outposts and guards along this road
  
* **Optional:** If you want, make a detour and grab the **Azshara** FP on your way to **Mulgore**, this is useful for when you're questing, and can be used to fly back up to **Ashenvale** from **Ratchet**. Just be careful in east region of [**Ashenvale**](https://imgur.com/G8RY2P3) 🖼️, there are Horde guards & mobs that will aggro you, even on the road!

* Once you've reached the [**Darkmoon Faire**](https://imgur.com/nPR7Mir) in **Mulgore**, accept the quest called **Torta's Egg** from [**Silas Darkmoon**](https://imgur.com/nUoQzP0) 🖼️

* After accepting the quest, make your way back up to **Ashenvale** until you reach [**The Zoram Strand**](https://imgur.com/9dAjQr2) 🖼️ using the same route as when you went down to **Mulgore**

* At **The Zoram Strand** kill Wrathtail Sea Witch/Sorceress/Razortail/Wave Rider until the egg drops

* Return to [**Silas Darkmoon**](https://imgur.com/nUoQzP0) 🖼️ in **Mulgore** using the same route as before and complete the quest!
